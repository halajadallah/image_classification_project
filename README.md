# Udacity Machine Learning nanodegree program

## Image classification project

This repository has my project submission for the assigned [dog-project](http://github.com/udacity/dog-project) (see the link for details in particular the raw dog-project.ipynb). 

My submission has two parts. The first concerns human face recognition compared to any other object. Here I used many methods such as OpenCV, building convolution neural network from scratch or using learning transfer of ResNet and Inception. 

The second part focuses on classifying dog images by dog type againg two ways where applied: building a convolution neural network from scratch and using transfere learning using the pretrained-weights of ResNet, VGG16, Xception and Inception CNNs.
